A library created to scrape Google Images.<br>
If you are looking for other image scrapers, JJLimmm has created image scrapers for Gettyimages, Shutterstock, and Bing. <br>

3. Windows OS (Other OS is not tested)

## Setup:
1. Open command prompt
2. Clone this repository (or [download](https://github.com/ohyicong/Google-Image-Scraper/archive/refs/heads/master.zip))

    git clone https://github.com/ohyicong/Google-Image-Scraper
    ```
3. Install Dependencies

    search_keys         = Strings that will be searched for
    number of images    = Desired number of images
    headless            = Chrome GUI behaviour. If True, there will be no GUI
    min_resolution      = Minimum desired image resolution
    max_resolution      = Maximum desired image resolution
    max_missed          = Maximum number of failed image grabs before program terminates. Increase this number to ensure large queries do not exit.
